There are three Ways of writing the code of JS ->
                                       1. Inline JS -> Inside the html tags.
                                                       <h1>Hello <script>Document.write("JS");</script></h1>

                                       2. Internal JS -> Inside the html file inside the script tag.
                                                        <script>Document.write("JS");</script>

                                       3. External JS -> Inside the another file and we have to link this js file to the html file.
                                                         <script src="index.js"></script>

Variables -> Variable is a container or memory blocks that is used to store the data.
             Rules -> 1. Variable names should be starts from alphabets , numbers are not allowed.
                      2. We cant use special character in variable names.
                      3. We cant give spaces in the name of variable.
                      4. Only unserscore allowed in variable name.
                      5. We cant use predefined keywords name and functions name as variable names.
